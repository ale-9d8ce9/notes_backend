the backend for my notes app, **still in development**, similar to excalidraw or freeform

## how to use
1. dowload or clone the repo
2. run `./notes/setup.sh` to set everything up
3. to start the server
    - run `node index.js` to see the logs in the terminal
    - open a terminal and run `bash run.sh` to save the logs

to archive logs run `./notes/archiveLogs.sh`

by default it run at http://localhost:8080/notes, the port and path can be changed in `index.js`
